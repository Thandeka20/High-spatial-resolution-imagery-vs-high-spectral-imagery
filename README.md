# High-spatail-resolution-imagery-vs-high-spectral-imagery
The following Github repository outlines the work done for my masters research project. This chapte is about comparing different imagery that have diffetent resolution to determine which imagery (high spatial vs high spectral) can discriminate invasive alien plants from native plants in South Africa. 
The components of theis chapter include:

Code: Contains jupyter notebooks fot code that inloves data acquisition and data processing of four satellite imagery (Sentinel-2, Aerial photographs, SPOT 6/7 and EMIT)

Results: Contains classified maps and tables with accuracy assessment

Report: Contains publushed papers from my masters thesis.
